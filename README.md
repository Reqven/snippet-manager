# snippet-manager
iOS code snippet manager with syntax highlighting.
This application should be using **Realm Framework** for persisting user data, and **UserDefaults** for user settings. It's not using any of these two for now, as I haven't had the time to implement them yet, next update!  

This application uses [Highlightr](https://github.com/raspu/Highlightr) for syntax highlighting.

**Todo list:**
- Realm Framework for user data
- UserDefaults for user settings
- Filtering snippets with the Searchbar 
- Add new snippet screen
- Show language used in TableView
- Share sheet
- ...
