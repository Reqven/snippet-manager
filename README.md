# snippet-manager
iOS application to manage code snippets.  
This application should be using **Realm Framework** for persisting data, and **UserDefaults** for user settings.  
It's not using any of these two for now, as I haven't had the time to implement them yet, next update!

**Todo list:**
- Realm Framework for user data
- UserDefaults for user settings
- Filtering snippets with the Searchbar 
- Add new snippet screen
- Show language used in TableView
- Share sheet
- ...
